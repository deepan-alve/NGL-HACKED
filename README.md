# NGL Clone - Cybersecurity Demonstration �
![sddefault](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27b3584-601e-417c-858e-bbc5e7c36369)

A **cybersecurity research project** demonstrating social engineering techniques through a pixel-perfect clone of the popular NGL (Not Gonna Lie) anonymous messaging platform. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 

⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY** - This project is designed to demonstrate phishing techniques and raise awareness about online security vulnerabilities.

---

## � Project Purpose
This project serves as a **cybersecurity demonstration** showing how easily malicious actors can:
- Create convincing clones of popular platforms
- Harvest user data through social engineering
- Exploit user trust in "anonymous" platforms
- Demonstrate the importance of URL verification and digital literacy

## ⚠️ Security Vulnerabilities Demonstrated
- **Visual Deception**: Identical UI/UX to the legitimate NGL platform
- **Domain Spoofing**: Could be deployed with a deceptive domain name
- **Data Collection**: Captures messages users believe are anonymous
- **Trust Exploitation**: Users share sensitive information believing in false anonymity
- **Social Engineering**: Leverages psychological trust in familiar interfaces

## �🌟 Technical Features
- 🎯 **Perfect UI Replication**: Pixel-perfect clone of NGL's interface
- �️ **Data Collection**: Captures and stores user messages with metadata
- ⏱️ **Rate Limiting**: Mimics original platform behavior to avoid suspicion
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Identical user experience across devices
- 🎨 **Authentic Design**: Maintains original color schemes and animations
- 🔐 **Backend Integration**: Stores data for analysis and demonstration
- 💾 **Database Storage**: Messages stored for cybersecurity research
- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: Optimized to feel like the real platform

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Backend Setup (for full demonstration):**

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Access Points:**
- **Main Demo**: `http://localhost:5173/` - The NGL clone interface
